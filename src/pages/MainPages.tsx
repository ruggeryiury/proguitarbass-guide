            <Paragraph>This guide will help you creating PRO Guitar/Bass parts for your customs, with every single PRO mode features explained.<br /><br />Here are some things you should consider before authoring PRO Guitar/Bass parts:</Paragraph>
            <ul className="list-disc">
                <List title="Playability VS. Accuracy">All PRO Guitar/Bass charts must follow their 5-lane charts, but certain dynamics and articulations are way easier to portrait on 5-lane charts. Sometimes, you'll chart different guitar sections and realize there's a big fret jumping between one charted section to the other, Then this happens, feel free to underchart, and even take a 4th note space away from the chart to let the player position its hand to keep playing the song. Songs were meant to be playable and this rule applies to everything. If you're in doubt of what to do, ask to any PRO Guitar/Bass player for opinions about how's the best approach for your song.</List>
                <List title="Basic music theory knowlegde">Just like PRO Keys parts, music theory plays a big role while charting PRO Guitar/Bass parts, so it's inevitable for you to understand basic concepts of playing guitar/bass to make PRO Guitar/Bass parts for your custom.</List>
            </ul>

                <Block children='PART REAL_GUITAR' noMarginLeft /> and <Block children="PART REAL_BASS" /> tracks are <strong>obrigatory</strong> even if your chart has notes above the 17-fret. Notes above the 17th fret must be transposed to suit in the 17-fret tracks while trying to connect the transposed notes without messing with the player's fret position too much. To do this, try to also transpose notes within a big section where the player can play all notes correctly.

                A chord is a group of notes sounded together, as a basis of harmony. On Rock Band 3, they're displayed as blue shapes, displaying only the lower note of a chord on its string and creating a shape based on it. Open notes will be displayed as white.

            <Title id='rootNoteIndicators'>Root Note Indicators</Title>
            <Paragraph>
                The game automatically calculates the invervals of each note of a chord and displays a name for it, but we need to tell it what scale the chord is. For this, we have <strong>Root Note Indicators</strong>. Placing a note aligned with a chord, starting with <Block>E-2</Block> (4), going up chromatically to <Block>Dâ™¯-1</Block> (15), you tell the game what scale the aligned chord (and following chords) are. You don't need to put a root note on <strong>every</strong> chord in a sequence, just place it aligned to the first chord, and all the following chords will be named using the scale you placed, until you change it to another root note.
                <br /><br />
                Root Note Indications don't need to be longer than a 1/16 note, even if the first chord aligned to it is a sustained one.
            </Paragraph>

            <Title id='slashChords'>Slash Chords</Title>
            <Paragraph>
                A slash chord is a chord which indicates emphasis of a bass note other than the root of the chord. When a chord is played, it is typically assumed the bass will emphasize the root of the chord. Occasionally, a different note is preferred and results in a chord with an alternate bass note.
                <br /><br />
                To turn a chord into a slash chord, you must place a <strong className="text-cyan-500">SLASH CHORD MARKER</strong> <Block>E-1</Block> (16) aligned with a root note indicator and a chord itself. Slash chords are notated in-game with a chord's root note, followed by a forward slash, followed by the alternate bass note. For example, <Block>G/B</Block> or <Block>D7/Fâ™¯</Block> are slash chords.
                <br /><br />
                Keep in mind that you're dealing with a <strong>marker</strong>, this means that all chords encopassing it will be displayed as slash chords as well, this is useful if you have a sequence of different slash chords.
                <br /><br />
                On slash chords, the game will always choose the bass note based on the note of the lowest string.
            </Paragraph>

            <Title id="omittingMutedStringsfromChords">Omitting Muted Strings from Chords</Title>
            <Paragraph>
                For chords with any muted string in-between, you must omit the muted string. If you encode a single string mute on a chord, the whole chord will appear muted in-game.
            </Paragraph>

            <Title id='hideChordName'>Hide Chord Name</Title>
            <Paragraph>
                The <strong className="text-cyan-500">HIDE CHORD NAME MARKER</strong> <Block>F-1</Block> (17) is handy when you deal with chords that don't consistently belong to any scale, or don't have any big importance on naming it, like two-string oblique bends. To hide chord names, place a <strong className="text-cyan-500">HIDE CHORD NAME MARKER</strong> encopassing any root note indicator you want its name not to be displayed in-game. After any hide chord name marker, the game will search chord names based on the last root note indicator placed (even if placed within the marker), unless you put another root note indicator aligned with any first chord after the marker.
            </Paragraph>

            <Title id='sharpFlatSwap'>Sharp/Flat Swap</Title>
            <Paragraph>
                The <strong className="text-cyan-500">SHARP/FLAT SWAP MARKER</strong> <Block>Fâ™¯-1</Block> (18) is used to change the accident symbols used on chords. The default accident symbol used on chords is based on the song's key signature and tonality (that is defined on the song's .dta file) and it follows the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className='tracking-tight inline-flex text-cyan-500 hover:underline'>circle of fifths</a> theory, but when song key changes in the middle of the song, the <strong className="text-cyan-500">SHARP/FLAT SWAP MARKER</strong> should be used to fit the symbol used on that specific key.
                <br /><br />
                The most notable example is on the Rock Band 3 on-disc song <em className="text-cyan-500">Foolin'</em>, by Def Leppard. The song key starts on A minor (which uses the sharp symbol as default), but on the pre-chorus/chorus, the song key changes to D minor (which uses the flat symbol), so the <strong className="text-cyan-500">SHARP/FLAT SWAP MARKER</strong> is used on the <Block>Bâ™­5</Block> chord, otherwise it would be shown as <Block>Aâ™¯5</Block>.
                <br /><br />
                Here is a table with all symbols used on all key signatures:

                There are three possible articulations of HO/PO notes:

Forcing HO/PO off is useful for songs with slow BPMs (100BPM or lower), since 1/16th note sequences aren't fast enough to avoid strumming.

                An arpeggio is a type of broken chord, in which the notes that compose a chord are played, mostly, in a rising or descending order. To place an arpeggio, you have the <strong className="text-cyan-500">ARPEGGIO MARKER</strong> <Block>Gâ™¯6</Block> (104) (for Expert difficulty).

This chord must be placed at the beginning of the <strong className="text-cyan-500">ARPEGGIO MARKER</strong>, aligned with a root note indicator and must have, at least, one playable note. Non-playable notes must be encoded on <Block bg="#7a8c00">MIDI CHANNEL 2</Block> to create the ghost shape of the chord.

                Any note/chord fragment that is compatible with the chord of the <strong className="text-cyan-500">ARPEGGIO MARKER</strong> are displayed as turquoise notes on every string.
                There are two main concepts of using the <strong className="text-cyan-500">ARPEGGIO MARKER</strong>:
            </Paragraph>
            <ul className="list-disc">

                <br /><br />
                The concept of using incompatible notes is that they can be played without undoing your fingers position for the asigned chord, althought specific cases can appear. Generally an incompatible note that is meant to be played with an unused finger on the chord formation, or losing any finger to play an open string is acceptable. All of these situations can let you go back to the compatible chord formation easily.

                Trill and Tremolo markers trigger free form lanes that appear on the track. These markers allow a a player to strum or play quickly without forcing them to playing the actual authored rhythm of the part. As long as the player is strumming or alternating at 160ms or faster, they will be allowed to continue playing in the free form lanes. If they dip below 160ms, the free form lanes will disappear, and they will be forced to play to the rhythm at which the part is authored.
                <br /><br />
                The threshold of 160ms is a hard coded number, so edge cases can creep up where using a trill marker may not feel as good as just playing the authored rhythm. Using Trill and Tremolo lanes as opposed to an authored section is a judgement call, but in general if the original playing happens very fast and without regard to tempo, if it would be very difficult to match the audio, or if there would be a very long stretch of 16th or 32nd notes it might be a good candidate for a trill or tremolo section.
