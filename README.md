</p>

Originally released as a *.PDF book*, then as a raw, yet stylish Tumblr page, my *PRO Guitar/Bass Guide* were written during my experiments with **Rock Band 3's** *PRO Guitar/Bass* authoring, discovering and testing brand new features with a big help from big *PRO Guitar/Bass* mode players (like [PinkyMilo]()).

I've stuctured my guide to be as most intuitive as possible, with every step explained, with videos with self-recorded guitar lines and MIDI samples, which can be downloaded and loaded on REAPER by just dragging with MIDI file into it.
